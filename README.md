# MNIST Digit Recognition
A project for self learning about using different machine learning models in recognizing hand written digits.

## Models included:
1. Clustering Approach
  * K-Means Clustering
2. Classification Approach
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Naive Bayes

## Conclusion
The trained SVM model has highest accuracy among all ML models with 95.6% accuracy
