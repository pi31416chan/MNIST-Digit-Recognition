# MNIST Digit Recognition
A project for self learning about using different machine learning models in recognizing hand written digits.

## Models included:
[***MNIST Digit Recognition.ipynb***]\
An exploration of multiple different algorithm and see their performance with the topic.\
Fit with 5000 samples of data for training.
1. Clustering Approach
  * K-Means Clustering
2. Classification Approach
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Naive Bayes


[***MNIST Digits Classifier.ipynb***]\
Another retry on KNN algorithm, fit with full set of data 60000 samples for training.

[***MNIST Digits MLP.ipynb***]\
Another revisit to this problem with MLP model.\

## Conclusion
The trained KNN model and the MLP model have highest accuracy among all ML models with both over 98.0% accuracy.\
This has also proven that over-fitting of model can be avoided if dataset for training is large.
